# Atmel-JFET-Tester
JFET Tester based on Atmel Hardware (Currently AVR8)

Current ADCs supported:
 * LTC2418 (24 bit SD, SPI) ** Mostly written
 * LTC2439 (16 bit SD, SPI) ** Pin compat with 2418, should be easy to code for too
 
Current microcontrollers supported:
 * ATTiny1634
 
Possible future uCs to support:
 * ATMega32U
 
Requirements:
D&W AG JFET Test Board 7.0.8+
